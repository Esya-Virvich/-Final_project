# Final_project
This repository contains my final project, namely a telegram bot that will provide recipes for dishes based on user preferences. More details below.

**Project functionality**
The project functionality includes the following functions:

~ Selecting the type of food processing (cook, fry, stew, bake, without heat treatment, in a slow cooker, in the microwave)

~ Selection of ingredients (vegetables, fruits, fish, meat, mushrooms, nuts, dried fruits, berries)

~ Select approximate cooking time (less than 30 minutes, more than 30 minutes, less than an hour, more than an hour)

**What is the benefit and purpose of the project?**
The benefit of the project is that:

~ Many people find it difficult to figure out what to cook.

~ Sometimes it can be difficult to adapt to existing products and find the right recipe

~ People often have limited time to prepare food and need to know exactly how long the cooking will take.

**Logic of the project**
Application algorithm:
1) User selection of the type of food processing for the dish
2) User selection of ingredients
3) User selection of approximate cooking time
4) Processing of received information
5) Obtaining a list of suitable recipes from the prepared database
6) Receiving a selection of recipes by the user
